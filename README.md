## Resources
1. [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)'s [Getting Started]((https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)) page has tutorials for installing python and additional resources for learning.
2. [Google](https://www.google.com/). If you have a question or problem! Don't be afraid to google it! There's not shame in it; all programmers do it.  Look for results from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
3. [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a great for practicing your coding skills at all levels using short word problems. The exercises get harder as you level up. Many languages are supported. Community solutions are provided.
4. [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) is a public interface for Git repositories. This is a great way to share your code and follow the things your friends are making. It can also be a great tool for learning.  Reading other people's code teaches you good practices.
5. [Python Website Tutorial](https://pythonhow.com/python-tutorial/flask/Building-a-website-with-Python-Flask/)
6. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) can be a great resource for programming help.  Provide your error codes or ask for examples of what you are trying to develop.
